Digital Assets used on the Site are not legal tender. Kairos is not a bank or depository institution.&nbsp;Digital Assets are not subject to protections or insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. As with any asset, the value of Digital Assets can increase or decrease and there can be a risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding, or investing in Digital Assets. Your Kairos account does not constitute an investment contract or a security, is not transferable and may not be traded, exchanged or sold to any third party under any circumstances.<br></p><p>Kairos does not provide any legal, tax or financial advice and you are strongly advised to obtain such advice prior to making any financial decision, including buying, trading, holding, or using Digital Assets. Kairos does not make any offers, recommendations, or invitations for you to deal in Digital Assets. You understand and acknowledge that the legal treatment of Digital Assets remains unsettled and may vary depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, which may affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets. </p><p>Transactions in Digital Assets are irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions are not recoverable. The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack. The nature of Digital Assets means that any technological difficulties experienced by Kairos or third parties may limit, delay or prevent the access or use of Digital Assets and/or cause losses of Digital Assets. Although Kairos takes precautionary measures to protect against cyber-threats, and we make effort to address your concerns and issues, circumstances may arise where losses or damages are incurred.<br></p><p>Make sure you understand such risks, as you are solely responsible for doing so. By using the Site, you agree that you have carefully considered and understood such risks.</p><h4><strong>Custody</strong><br></h4><p>Our custody (“Custody”) Service allows you to store eligible Digital Assets purchased or created from Kairos in a Custody Wallet accessible through your Account.&nbsp;</p><p>Title to your Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet shall remain with you at all times and shall not transfer to Kairos. Kairos will not transfer, sell, loan or otherwise rehypothecate Digital Assets held in a Custody Wallet unless specifically instructed by you, except as required by valid court order, competent regulatory agency, government agency or applicable law. As title owner of assets, you bear all risk of loss. Kairos shall have no liability for any Digital Asset price fluctuations or any or all loss of Digital Assets. Kairos will use reasonable care and reasonable efforts to store and secure Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>You understand that your use of the Custody Service does not create a fiduciary relationship between you and Kairos. Kairos does not have any fiduciary duty to you. Please note that when you use our Custody Service to store Digital Assets you will not receive a financing fee, rewards or financial compensation of any kind on eligible Digital Assets so stored. Your Custody Wallet is not covered by insurance against losses. Kairos retains the right to set-off any Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet against any obligations you may have to us.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Transfer</strong><br></h4><p>When you purchase or acquire Digital Assets using a Fiat currency like a credit card, Kairos will first restrict the transfer of the Digital Assets. This Holding Period remains in effect until your Fiat payment has been cleared and confirmed for any reasonable reason, including but not limited to inaccurate or misleading information provided by you, or any doubt or suspicion of fraud, misrepresentation, a sanctioned transaction, money laundering, terrorism financing, credit card disputes, or other financial crime. Kairos shall seek to become satisfied with the status of your payment within a reasonable period of time. Once satisfied, the Digital Asset will be able to be Transferred to other virtual addresses at your request.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no Holding Period for Digital Assets purchased with Cryptocurrency.</p><p>When you make a Transfer request, you will be required to provide the details of the virtual address to which you wish to receive the Digital Asset. In the event that the details you provide are inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, your Digital Assets may be permanently lost. We will not be liable for any loss that results from inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading details that you may provide for such transfer. If the transfer address you specify is one to which we are unable to process transfers, we will have no liability for any resulting failure or delay in processing your requested Transfer. Kairos and our third-party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could result in the immediate halt of Transfers either temporarily or permanently. Provided that Kairos has taken reasonable commercial and operational measures to prevent such events in technical systems controlled by Kairos, Kairos is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of transactions.</p><h4><strong>Taxes</strong><br></h4><p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to your use of the Site, and to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Website, and view your profile.</p><h4>Do we use cookies?</h4><p>We may use cookies to access or store vital account information.</p><h4>Is your information transferred internationally?</h4><p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see “Will your information be shared with anyone?” above), in and other countries.</p><p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p><p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p><h4>Do we collect information from minors?</h4><p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p><p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p><p>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.</p><p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at kairos.art/contact.</p><h4>Account information</h4><p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can log in to your account settings and update your user account, or contact us using the contact information provided.</p><p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.

If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Website.</p><p>Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below.

At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </p><h4>Do California residents have specific privacy rights?</h4><p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p><p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Website, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Website.
